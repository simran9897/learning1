Hey Friends,
Hope everyone is doing great and best in health!Let me introduce first, myself Simran Bhatia.
Basically I am a Digital Marketing Executive since 2018.I've worked and working for the organizations
who provide services related to app & web development,data entry, eCommerce, digital marketing and more.
Also, graduated in the year 2018 by successfully completing computer science & engineering. Earlier, I wasn't
that much interested in coding and all but when I stepped in an organization I loved the work web developers do like how they beautifully
design the website, add animations, use of HTML, CSS,etc. The day I started analyzing their work, an inner
voice said to me. Yar it's kinda interesting:nerd: . You should try..! So, here I am following my heart.

    <h3>The First Image Linking</h3>
    
    <p>
        The first image uses the width attribute (set to 128 pixels),
        but the style in the head section overrides it, and sets the width to 100%.
