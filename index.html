           <h2>Story Line</h2>
           <p>
            The second season of the web series is gleaned from the same plot of season 1 but the locations and the city are changed but the problems of Mini are the same. The stalker is still stalking her but now he changes his dares and games and the way of stalking. This time the stranger became more dangerous and dark this time the stalker asks her to do sexual acts in public with an unknown person. It’s interesting to watch that Mini is able to complete all the tasks which are assigned by the stalker and she will be survival this time or not.

            This time the viewers will get to know that who is the stalker and why is he chasing Mini. But for that viewers need to watch all episodes of “Hello Mini 2”.If we looking at the performance of the Anuja Joshi she still plays the role very decently. She looks pretty in the frame so performed well. She plays the role very perfectly in every plot whether it’s emotional or terrifying. All the performances of the actors are neutral. There are 10 episodes is available in the Hello Mini 2.
